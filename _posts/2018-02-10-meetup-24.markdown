**Description**  
In this meetup we will be talking about Secure Payment Channels using Lightning Network. [Lightning Networks](http://lightning.network/) are an example of multi-party Smart Contract
(programmable money) using bitcoin's built-in scripting. We will explore how Lightning Networks can be used to create a network of payment channels that can enable transactions between parties that don't have a direct payment channel setup between them.

This will be an informal and interactive session with hopefully a lot of questions and shared exploration of this interesting technology :-)

Please comment if anyone wants to talk about other similar Payment Channels on Blockchain like Raiden Networks.

This is going to be an open discussion lead by [Nikhil Krishna Nair](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nikhilkrishna)
