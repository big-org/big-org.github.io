**Description**  
Hashgraph is a data structure and consensus algorithm that claims to be faster, fairer, and more secure than blockchain. Hashgraph is not currently available on a public network / ledger so there is no cryptocurrency at this time. It is currently available only for private networks for enterprise/commercial applications. In this episode we take a look at how hashgraph works and how the technology compares to the blockchain based bitcoin system.

Topics:

* What is Hashgraph? Basic concepts
* How hashgraph transactions work
* Sybil and DDoS attacks / How hashgraph handles attacks
* Advantages of hashgraph
* Overall opinion about hashgraph

**Speakers**  
This is going to be an open discussion lead by [Nikhil Krishna Nair](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nikhilkrishna)
